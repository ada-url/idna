The ada-url/ada library is a C++ library implementing the `to_array` and `to_unicode` functions from the [Unicode Technical Standard](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#ToUnicode) supporting a wide range of systems. It is suitable for URL parsing.

According to our benchmarks, it can be faster than ICU.

## Requirements

- A recent C++ compiler supporting C++17. We test GCC 9 or better, LLVM 10 or better and Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.

## Usage

```C++
    std::string_view input = // non-empty UTF-8 string, must be percent decoded
    std::string idna_ascii = ada::idna::to_ascii(input);
    if(idna_ascii.empty()) {
        // There was an error.
    }
```
